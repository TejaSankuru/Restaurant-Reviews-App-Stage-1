##How to run the APP:

2. Project needs a local server to run.
    * Open a bash command line window in the repository folder.
    * Check if python is installed in your computer by typing python -V or py -V. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
    * If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use py -m http.server 8000 or python3 -m http.server 8000.
